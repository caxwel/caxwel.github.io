I"¥<p>Hello internet, truly exciting news here. Iâ€™ve hopefully become the sort of person who blogs about my projects.
<br /><br />
This website is a sort of project in itself, so letâ€™s talk about that.
<br />
My plan for the time being is to use a new technology or framework in every project I start, so hyperfocusing on Extreme CSS Elements alone (as is my usual way) isnâ€™t going to cut it for this one. Wonder what Iâ€™ll do?
<br /><br />
Well, for now I am using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> for the first time to write this, and itâ€™s very interesting so far. I just linked to Jekyll via markdown. Weird!
<br /><br />
I think this will be a fun oneâ€¦</p>
