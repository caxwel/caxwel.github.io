Hello! I’m a software engineer and artist based in Tokyo, living in my fourth country and most likely drawing in my fiftieth sketchbook.
<br/> <br/>
Check out my tech talk on making art out of pure CSS <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doq3p1wKBvo">here</a> at 2:04:25!

I’m always looking forward to seeing what my next project will be as a software engineer and can’t wait to discover my next step.
