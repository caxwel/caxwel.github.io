Hello internet, truly exciting news here. I've hopefully become the sort of person who blogs about my projects.
This website is a sort of project in itself, so let's talk about that.
My plan for the time being is to use a new technology or framework in every project I start, so hyperfocusing on Extreme CSS Elements alone (as is my usual way) isn't going to cut it for this one. Wonder what I'll do?
Well, for now I am using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for the first time to write this, and it's very interesting so far. I just linked to Jekyll via markdown. Weird!
I think this will be a fun one...
